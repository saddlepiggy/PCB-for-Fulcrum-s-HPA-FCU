I just made a PCB, design is not by me. Until stated, the PCB has not been tested but I have a small batch on order and will test it soon. Schematic is a copy from this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjRXz0WjYpU&t=682s

Only change is that I used potentiometers designed to be perpendicular because I accidentally ordered those instead of the ones in the video. The pins can still be bent and laid flat.

Files included are schematic, gerber, BOM, and pick-and-place.
